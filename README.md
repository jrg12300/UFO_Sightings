# UFO_Sightings
module 11


Overview of the analysis:

  In this analysis, a .js file with UFO sighting data was given to us. We used java and html to filter this data in a webpage setting. There were 5 different filters usable.



Results:

  Upon opening the page, the data is unfiltered. The entire dataset is on display. The user then enters in the filters. It's pretty straightforward. 



Summary:
  
  One drawback to this webpage is that you cannot search for keywords in the comments. I would also change the state list to a dropdown menu/search type. I would reccomend adding that, as well as a filter or sort option on duration.
